		"I'm Nicklas. I have been coding for quite a while now, as I started by making my first small game for my sister when I was around 10 years old. From there on I just loved the experience of going from nothing to a working program/app/game. I have made both apps, games, programs and websites and have been tinkering with a lot of different kinds of technologies. I would call myself a Full Stack developer as I love to tinker with the Backend and make the Frontend look amazing.",
